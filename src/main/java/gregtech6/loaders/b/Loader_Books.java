		, "Any USB Stick will do, Images and Text Files are not that large and won't require more than USB 1.0, even though you can ofcourse use higher USB Tiers aswell, thanks to downwards compatibility."
		, "Now you need to refill your Printers Ink reserves, depending on what Job you want to do with it. It only accepts the Chemical Dyes for this purpose. Black = Text, CMYK for Images, Blue or White for Blueprints."

		, "First of all you need to make sure that the Boiler you use fits the Burning Box you place below. The Tooltips will hint you the proper values you can use. The Boiler itself does accept heat from all directions, not just the Bottom."
		, "Then you need to fill the Boiler with Water on the Sides, so that you can generate Steam with it. Placing a Funnel on it and rightclicking that Funnel with a Water Bucket works for filling aswell."
		, "But if you use regular Water instead of distilled Water, then you will end up with calcification and a constant decrease of Steam-Creation-Efficiency. No risk of explosion due to that though, since it just makes less Steam per Water."
		, "Inserting Water into an empty hot Boiler, it will rapidly increase the Pressure maybe causing it to explode, depending on how much heat and water you insert at once."
		, "If a Boiler stores too much Heat without being able to convert Water into Steam, then it will simply melt and break, leaving you with a giant mess."
		, "Steam Turbines and Engines emit distilled Water to their Sides, which makes it possible to simply cycle the distilled Water back into the Boiler for having less calcification going on."
		, "The Boilers have a Barometer on their Front, their ideal State is if the Line is inside the dark green Area, so in the middle of the Barometer itself. The closer it is to the red Area, the closer it is to exploding."
		, "Steam Engines work best if they are in green Mode, if they are too blue then they have not enough Steam (look for Boiler Calcification if it happens after a while of running normally)."
		, "If the Engines are too Red then they will release the Steam and stop running (no Explosions, just a waste of Steam and a fizzing noise)."

		, "The first Hint is obvious: ALWAYS. READ. THE. ENTIRE. TOOLTIP. FIRST! The Tooltips often contain the Information you need, but not many people think about reading them. They usually contain all the Stats of the Machine."
		, "If a Machine doesn't process a certain Recipe (but does others), then you are not supplying enough Power. This is ALWAYS the Issue. The Tier of a Machine determines how much more Energy it consumes, than the normal Recipe."
		, "The Tiers of Machines are as follows: anything between 16 and 64 Generic Units per Tick is Tier ONE\nTier 2: 65-256\nTier 3: 257-1024\nTier 4: 1025-4096\nTier 5: 4097-16192"
		, "If the Tier of the Machine you are using is in a higher Range than the Tier of the Recipe (see its GU/t) it will multiply the required Input GU/t by 4 and half the Processing time, making the Recipe twice as expensive."
		, "And yes, 64 GU/t is STILL TIER ONE, you seriously have to insert that much into a Tier 1 Machine! It is often possible to use the Motor/Heater/etc of a higher Tier on the lowest Power Input to get the GU/t."
		, "GT6 Electric Power is widely compatible with all Mods that use the IC² API, such as:\nIC², IC²-Classic, IC²-Addons, Railcraft, Forestry and more!"
		, "Things emitting a Voltage less than 1024 EU/t are even capable of powering the non-IC² Machines of the following Mods:\nGalacticraft and it's Addons, Applied Energistics, Immersive Engineering, OpenModularTurrets, TechGuns and even GT5U!"
		, "Burning Boxes of any kind are always a Fire Hazard, make sure to only have Fireproof Stuff around them! The only ways to turn those Boxes off are placing a solid Block in front of them or the Fire Extinguishers."
		, "You want to move Water or get Milk, but don't have an Iron Bucket? Try making a Wooden Bucket for that Task, it's cheaper, even if it only works for a small sortiment Liquids."
		, "If you need a Printer Manual, then just insert Chemical Black Dye and an empty vanilla Book into it and apply Energy. It will instantly print that Manual."
		, "The Bathing Pot and the Bath can dye Leather Armor using Liquid Dyes.\nYou can wash Ores early on by throwing them into a filled vanilla Cauldron. Also GT Pipes can fill Cauldrons with Water."
		, "Space out Machines a little in order to be able to automate them later without causing a huge Clusterfuck. Always have enough space for 2 Blocks inbetween each Machine, if not 3! Disregard the eventual Loss of Power, it's not worth it."

		, "Creepers\n===================\nCreepers are sneaky, suicidal, leafy sticks on 4 short Legs, which will blow up when they are close by. They drop Gunpowder and will not deal any damage aside from the explosion when you let them come close."
		, "Creepers\n===================\nIf a Creeper is struck by Lightning it will become supercharged and will explode with a much larger force. Creepers in general when shot by a Skeleton, will drop Music Discs, which are usable for the Jukebox."
		, "Creepers\n===================\nIn order to detonate, a Creeper needs to see the Player, due to this it is always recommended to take the high Ground as you can hide behind the Cliff you are standing on more easily."
		, "Creepers\n===================\nWater is also a good place to melee a Creeper, as knockback will get it out of explosion Range, and even if it explodes it will not cause Damage to the ground, due to the Water absorbing the shock."
		, "Creepers\n===================\nFor Melee Combat in general it is adviced to have Weapons with a strong Knockback so you don't need to sprint to knock the Creeper out of the Detonation Zone. You can also just shoot an Arrow first and then melee."
		, "Creepers\n===================\nLast but not least, you can always just drop Water between you and the Creeper, it will slow it down considerable and if its about to explode anyways, then it won't damage the Terrain."

		, "Skeletons\n===================\nSkeletons, usually named after Fonts and armed with Bow and Arrows. They are good at aiming, some of them are even capable of picking up dropped Weapons and Armor."
		, "Skeletons\n===================\nIf they somehow kill Creepers, those Creepers will drop Music Discs. Killing a Skeleton on long Range will yield the Sniper Duel Achievement aswell."
		, "Skeletons\n===================\nIn order to not have a bad time with Skeletons, you need to either keep a Safe distance from them and shoot them from far away, or to quickly engage them with Melee Attacks, Speed is useful for this purpose."
		, "Skeletons\n===================\nWhen you charge at a Skeleton, strave slightly to the right or left in order to have less Arrows hit you, any way to instantly kill them with one blow, will greatly reduce the chance of more Arrows flying at you."
		, "Skeletons\n===================\nIf you have a Sword then blocking with it will reduce the Damage of Arrows. This can easily be used even during Melee to not get that large amounts of Damage, even if you get hit."
		, "Skeletons\n===================\nBacking a Skeleton into a Corner, by pushing it or knocking it back for example, will result in the Arrow getting Stuck in the Wall in a glitchy fashion and therefore not flying at you or damaging you."
		, "Skeletons\n===================\nWalls of any kind are useful, but what really helps (if you are prepared) is Sugar Canes / Reeds as they can block their view on you, while letting you shoot through."
		, "Skeletons\n===================\nYou can also use Saplings and (sadistically) Bonemeal to instantly create a small Forest as a Shield in the Grasslands."
		, "Skeletons\n===================\nBeing in Water makes you an easy Target for the Skeleton, since you are slow and constantly get knocked back. But the Skeleton being in Water can be worse as it bounces up and down without losing accuracy!"
		, "Skeletons\n===================\nBut if both you and the Skeleton are in deep water then diving below the surface and attacking the Skeleton from below is the best advise I can give, as the Skeletons often miss at steep angles."
		, "Skeletons\n===================\nIn some cases it is possible to just drop a Stone or a Wooden Sword for the Skeleton to pick up, they will drop their Bow in this case. However, this does not work on every Skeleton!"
		, "Skeletons\n===================\nSkeletons are grouped amoung the Undead Mobs, meaning they can be damaged by Sunlight, since it sets them on Fire. The Smite Enchant will also help a lot."
		, "Skeletons\n===================\nDue to being undead, Healing Splash Potions deal damage to them, while poisoning ones heal them. Since Skeletons shoot Arrows, it is a good Idea to wear Armor with Projectile Protection on it."
		, "Skeletons\n===================\nIt is always a good Idea to just make Skeletons attack each other or other Mobs in order to make the attacked Mob angry at them (instead of you), causing them to kill each other."
		, "Spider Jockeys\n===================\nEver saw a Skeleton Ride a Spider? Yeah its a terrifying picture. The speed and mobility of a Spider and a 'Turret' on its back."
		, "Spider Jockeys\n===================\nTo fight them you can use easy tricks, like making the Spider crawl up a wall into the Roof, crushing the Skeleton that rides it in the process."
		, "Spider Jockeys\n===================\nIn general you can apply the Strategies for both the Skeletons and the Spiders, to this combo. It's always the best solution to just shoot them from far away though."
		, "Spider Jockeys\n===================\nIf you have a Bow then go for the Skeleton first, if you have to Melee then go for the Spider. Alternatively you can wait for the Sun to burn the Skeleton before engaging."
		, "Wither Skeletons\n===================\nWither Skeletons are just like normal Skeletons with a Stone Sword, that instead of Arrows will drop regular Coal. They also are 3 Blocks tall and can absorb your Health."
		, "Wither Skeletons\n===================\nWhile Witherskeletons behave like any other humanoid Melee Mob, they are relatively fast and less stupid than Zombie Pigmen. If you want to know if you can handle one, practise on Zombie Pigmen first."
		, "Wither Skeletons\n===================\nDue to being about 3m tall, just like Endermen, you can essentially hide behind a 2m tall Roof and grind them into Ashes, uhh I mean Coal."
		, "Wither Skeletons\n===================\nIn Melee Situations, walking backwards and swinging is the best way to fight them without getting yourself harmed, but watch out for Fire and Lava behind you."
		, "Wither Skeletons\n===================\nAn Iron Golem is a good Idea to have with you, just take Iron Blocks and a Pumpkin with you. The Iron Golem will turn every hostile Mob in the area into scraps."
		, "Wither Skeletons\n===================\nThose black Skeletons spawn alongside regular Skeletons with Bow & Arrow inside a Nether Fortress, and they are the only really aggressive Mob there, aside from Blazes."
		, "Wither Skeletons\n===================\nIf you end up fighting both a Wither Skeleton and a Blaze, the best is to hide outside the Range of the Blaze and trying to fight the Skeleton first, or to bring the Skeleton between the Blaze and yourself."
		, "Wither Skeletons\n===================\nSince most of the times you are in the Nether with these Mobs, placing a Nether Portal close by to lure Mobs inside it, by hiding behind it, might be a good Idea (if you don't plan to use that Portal later)."
		, "Wither Skeletons\n===================\nThe Heads, which are dropped by every 40th Wither Skeleton, can be used to summon the Wither, but the Wither is being talked about in another Book."

		, "Zombies\n===================\nZombies, the most common Mob in Minecraft. Zombies always attack with Melee Damage and they can wield Weapons and wear Armor."
		, "Zombies\n===================\nZombies are grouped amoung the Undead Mobs, meaning they can be damaged by Sunlight, since it sets them on Fire. However, this does not apply to Baby Zombies!"
		, "Zombies\n===================\nDue to being undead, Healing Splash Potions deal damage to them, while poisoning ones heal them. The Smite Enchant is a good way to cause a lot of damage on them."
		, "Zombies\n===================\nDo not underestimate their Melee Damage and try to keep a safe distance while attacking them, make sure they dont hit you when you Melee them yourself."
		, "Zombies\n===================\nWhile wearing a Helmet they are immune to the Sun, that is until the Helmet loses all of its durability and breaks as it gets damaged when worn by a Zombie in Sunlight."
		, "Zombies\n===================\nZombies are attracted by Villagers, you can use them to distract them. If you want them to murder that Village, that is."
		, "Zombies\n===================\nThey can detect you from very far distances and will therefore end up swarming you from all directions, if you are not careful."
		, "Zombies\n===================\nBuild yourself a small fortification if you are in the wild. Zombies luckily cannot break Blocks so they won't be able to attack you if you build it right."
		, "Zombies\n===================\nSince Zombies normally group up on you due to coincedential pathfinding, it is well advised to just throw Splash Potions of Regeneration or Healing at them, since they are damaged by those."
		, "Zombies\n===================\nAs always, Bow and Arrows can help you killing Zombies, it is a good Idea to use golden Arrows or other Smite Arrows if possible. But usually there are too many of them to kill all."
		, "Zombies\n===================\nUse Knockback on Zombies even if not needed, otherwise there might be too many Zombies grouping up at you if you are surrounded, so keep them at distance."
		, "Zombies\n===================\nKeep Zombies in the Water, they are almost helpless there and can't shoot you like Skeletons would. They are swimming much slower than you do."
		, "Zombies\n===================\nIron Golems are made for killing Zombies, they might be a viable option for your purposes."
		, "Zombies\n===================\nThe official Mojang term for Zombies wearing golden Armor is 'Zom-Bling'."
		, "Baby Zombies\n===================\nAnnoying little Bastards would be a better Name for them, not only that they are immune to Sunlight, they are also very fast and hard to hit!"
		, "Baby Zombies\n===================\nIf you didn't need the Anti Zombie Strategies before, then now you probably need to use them, since those little things can ruin your day."
		, "Baby Zombies\n===================\nIf you have the option, go for the Water, they aren't fast there. Other than that, mow your lawn and then aim low and hit them as fast as you can!"
		, "Chicken Jockeys\n===================\nThought it couldn't get any worse? Chickens are faster than those Baby Zombies and now they actually ride the Chickens!"
		, "Chicken Jockeys\n===================\nShoot the Chicken, yes get rid of it as fast as possible, you won't be able to Melee it as the Zombie is in the way, but you can try to shoot it!"
		, "Chicken Jockeys\n===================\nOther than that? Run for your life and try to either find a pond of water or use a Water Bucket on them, maybe you get it to dismount by doing so!"
		, "Zombie Pigmen\n===================\nZombie Pigmen, usually wielding a Golden Sword and dropping Gold Nuggets. The only pieceful Zombie, well peaceful until a Player harms it."
		, "Zombie Pigmen\n===================\nIf a Player does any damage to a Zombie Pigman, all the other Pegmen get angry and try to kill you, not only are they pretty fast, but they also do lots of Damage!"
		, "Zombie Pigmen\n===================\nZombie Pigmen are immune to Fire and the Sun, if you happen to find one in the Overworld (Pig struck by Lightning, or fresh from a Portal) it is usually safe to kill."
		, "Zombie Pigmen\n===================\nThe easiest Solution is not to harm them, but it always can happen that you accidentially do harm to them, or you mine the Ores of that Nether Ores Mod."
		, "Zombie Pigmen\n===================\nIn that case, pillar up or dig yourself in, as fast as possible! You don't want to die instantly and drop all your Inventory into the Nether."
		, "Zombie Pigmen\n===================\nOnce you have done that, make yourself a comfortable spot to attack the Pigmen from a space where they cant attack you."
		, "Zombie Pigmen\n===================\nSince most of the times you are in the Nether with these Mobs, placing a Nether Portal close by to lure Mobs inside it, by hiding behind it, might be a good Idea (if you don't plan to use that Portal later)."
		, "Zombie Pigmen\n===================\nAs they are undead like normal Zombies aswell, Splash Potions of Regeneration and Healing can deal great damage to them, while leaving yourself unharmed."
		, "Zombie Villagers\n===================\nThey behave just like normal Zombies, even though they look much worse, the only difference is that you can cure them to get Villagers, what will be explained in the following Pages."
		, "Zombie Villagers\n===================\nFirst of all, you need a good place to actually cure that Zombie without other Zombies turning the Villager right back into the undead Green."
		, "Zombie Villagers\n===================\nFor that you need to know, that the Transformation back into a Villager for some reason goes by faster if you use vanilla Iron Bars for the Cage."
		, "Zombie Villagers\n===================\nOnce you got the Cage, there are multiple Options on the Item you use to cure the Villager Zombie. There are multiple options."
		, "Zombie Villagers\n===================\nSplash Potions of Weakness + Golden Apples are one way. Holy Water or the rainbow colored Cure-All Pill are other alternatives. Get the Item of your choice and continue."
		, "Zombie Villagers\n===================\nNow you need to somehow lure the Zombie Villager into your Cage. Don't worry, the Villager won't remember that you punched them while they were a Zombie."
		, "Zombie Villagers\n===================\nA fishing Rod can also work wonders on moving the Zombie into the right directions. Punching them into a pit and closing it off, will work aswell."
		, "Zombie Villagers\n===================\nIf your Cage is outside (or improvised), then make sure the Sun won't burn the Villager before you can heal them. Add a Roof or something to your Cage, once you caught them."
		, "Zombie Villagers\n===================\nSo, now that you got the Villager into a Cage, you can heal them. Once you have done that, transport the Villager somewhere else, maybe with Rails and Minecarts."

		, "Spiders\n===================\nSpiders, octo-legged, climbing, pastry selling Arthropods, that can jump at you. Often accompanied by a random Potion Effect, which doesn't ever run out, making them invisible, resistant, regenerating or faster."
		, "Spiders\n===================\nThey are fast, usually faster than you unless you run. They can also climb to a certain extend, so Walls won't help much, however Spiders can easily get stuck on ceilings, where they could fall down on you!"
		, "Spiders\n===================\nThe normal way to beat them is already very effective, just melee or shoot them. They have less Health than other Mobs. The Bane of Arthropods Enchant is very effective on them."
		, "Spiders\n===================\nSpiders will jump/pounce at you when they are close, if you time it right then hitting them will knock them back farther than usual. Also always have the high Ground when fighting Spiders as otherwise they'll jump you."
		, "Spiders\n===================\nIf you are in a Desert, then look out for some tsundere Plants called 'Cactus', plural being 'Cactii', Spiders apparently love climbing them, damaging themselves in the process."
		, "Spiders\n===================\nAt daytime, Spiders are tired and usually not aggressive. If you attack them then and with critical hits, then they will die by the surprise and won't damage you."
		, "Spiders\n===================\nRunning is the best thing to do when fighting Spiders, not running away, I mean running at them or keeping a safe distance during combat. Spiders are immune to Poison, so splashing them with it isn't effective at all."
		, "Spiders\n===================\nThey get stuck at overhangs, meaning if you build a pillar with 4 overhang blocks (one at each side) Spiders won't get up and you can damage them from ontop of that pillar."
		, "Spiders\n===================\ndue to being 2m in diameter, hiding in a 1m tight spot is a good idea when fighting regular Spiders. This doesn't work on the poinsonous Cave Spiders though."
		, "Cave Spiders\n===================\nCave Spiders are just 1m in diameter and they inject poison when they melee you. They normally only spawn inside Mineshafts, since there are Spawners for them over there."
		, "Cave Spiders\n===================\nThe Spawners are surrounded by lots and lots of Webs, those webs will slow you down, so take your Sword or Silk Touch Shears and slice those Webs away, also useful if you need String."
		, "Cave Spiders\n===================\nCave Spiders often get Stuck at the wooden Pillars or hide in the ceiling at those, so be careful where you walk as they will fall down at you very surprisingly despite making lots of noise."
		, "Cave Spiders\n===================\nDue to them being poisonous, Milk or any sort of Antidote Pill are useful Items to have on your Hotbar. Also hiding from them by closing off Paths is very needed sometimes."

		, "Endermen\n===================\nSince Endermen don't usually attack you, I presume you just want their Pearls, and for that an Enderman Trap is a good Idea."
		, "Endermen\n===================\nThe simplest Method is just standing below a 2m tall ceiling, so they cannot get to you. And then stare at every Enderman around to let them rage at you and attack you."
		, "Endermen\n===================\nAnother way would be the use of Water Buckets to shield yourself off. Also they can only teleport distances of at least 16m btw, no shorter teleports are possible for them."
		, "Endermen\n===================\nAs you may know, normal Arrows are pretty much worthless against them, that is why you should use Arrows with Disjunction on it (Silver), in order to prevent them from teleporting."

		, "Endermen\n===================\nMelee attacks only work out if you look at their feet while swinging, as they will teleport away when you stare at them, since staring at them would freeze them into place."
		, "Endermen\n===================\nThe Weakness Potion Effect is capable of preventing an Enderman from Teleporting, make use of that and splash them. (Note, that it is GregTech adding that Feature!)"
		, "Ender Dragon\n===================\nThe Ender Dragon is essentially the Queen of the Endermen. She flies around between Obsidian Pillars with Magical Ender Crystals, that will regenerate her Health. Her attack pattern is Kamikaze Melee."
		, "Ender Dragon\n===================\nShe will obliterate every normal Block (except Endstone, Bedrock and Obsidian) when flying through it. She is immune to Knockback and Fire, and weak to the Disjunction Enchant found in Silver."
		, "Ender Dragon\n===================\nThe first thing you have to do is making sure you don't get knocked into the Void. Building Walls will only help if you have Obsidian with you, since she can't break it, unlike everything else you can bring."
		, "Ender Dragon\n===================\nOnce you are safe on the Main Island, you have to go and get rid of the Ender Crystals. They can easily be destroyed by Snowballs and Arrows. Do not melee those Crystals as they deal a huge explosion damage."
		, "Ender Dragon\n===================\nDue to the Kamikaze Ram Attack, the Ender Dragon can be fought in Melee aswell as with Bow and Arrow. Use Weapons with the Disjunction Enchant and get yourself some Strength Buff in order to deal more melee."
		, "Ender Dragon\n===================\nDuring the Fight it can happen that you stare at Endermen by accident, in order to prevent that you could either wear a Pumpkin as Hat and press F1, or just try to only look at a slight upwards angle."

		, "Blazes\n===================\nAs they shoot Fireballs, they can be hard to get close to. My advice is either just shooting them with a Bow or being very creative and using a Fishing Rod to reel them in for Melee Combat."
		, "Blazes\n===================\nYou can also just hide behind a Wall and wait for them to come close, and then strike and hide again, so they don't get a chance to fire back. Building such a Wall between you and the Blazes is also a good Idea."

		, "Ghasts\n===================\nPunching their Fireballs back at them can be hard to do, especially with Lag, but Arrows can deflect the fireballs aswell, meaning you can shoot Arrows at the Fireballs as a defense."
		, "Ghasts\n===================\nIn general any form of ranged Attack is advised, because it happens very rarely, that a Ghastis close enough to the ground to actually melee it."
		, "Ghasts\n===================\nIt can happen very often that you are unprepared and a Ghast shows up trying to blow you into smithereens. In that case, run away and hide, first."
		, "Ghasts\n===================\nAfter you are done finding a hiding Spot, look at where exactly the Ghast is right now, so you can stay out of its Range. Then either continue your business or shoot the Ghast."
		, "Ghasts\n===================\nIf you are going to deflect a Ghast Blast the melee way, then use a Sword for that, as it gives you a slightly increased Range. This is especially useful if you cant use a Bow."
		, "Ghasts\n===================\nGhasts are the normal kind of Mob, they are neither Undead nor Spiders, there is no special Enchant against them, and Potions work normally on them."

//      The Wither is a tough mob to fight.
//      Having more health than the Ender Dragon or iron golems, the Wither can be quite hard to fight if one is not prepared and taken the necessary precautions.
//      First of all, Withers do not naturally spawn.
//      You must get 4 soul sand from a Nether fortress and 3 wither skeleton skulls.
//      Wither skeleton skulls are dropped by wither skeletons when killed, however, they have only a 2.5% chance of dropping it.
//      You should use a looting enchantment sword if possible.
//      Once you get your three skulls and four soul sand, find a place to spawn the wither.
//      To spawn the wither, one needs to place the soul sand in a t-shaped arrangement (exactly like an iron golem's iron block arrangement).
//      Then, the three wither skulls are placed on the top of each of the three soul sand blocks that are on the top layer.
//      Beware however, once you place the last wither skeleton skull to complete the wither spawning arrangement, the wither will start to spawn.
//      We will come back to this spawning process later. 
//      Supplies needed to fight the wither depend on strategy.
//      The most strategic way requires these items:
//      A full set of diamond armor (with a high protection enchantment, thorns may be useful but is not necessary),
//      A sword with either sharpness or smite (fire aspect does not work on the wither),
//      A bow with Power IV or V, punch, and infinity, Obviously an arrow (or many if you don't have the infinity enchantment),
//      some instant health II splash potions, some strength II potions, and one or two enchanted golden apples.
//      You will see how all of these will help in the following combat strategy.
//      Again, this is one of the infinitely possible combat strategies there are for fighting the wither.
//      Make sure you are an ample distance from your house before spawning the wither.
//      This mob has the potential to be incredibly destructive.
//      When you make the arrangement for spawning the wither correctly as said above, you should see a mob appear that is black and has three heads.
//      Also you will notice a boss health bar much similar to the Ender Dragon's health bar.
//      You will also see the bar gradually filling up.
//      At this time, get your sword, bow, apples, and potions in hand and equip your armor.
//      You don't have much time.
//      Run away as fast as you can and be a good distance away from the wither as the health bar fills up.
//      When the bar is full, the wither lets out an explosion that destroys some of the terrain around it.
//      You are now ready to start fighting. The wither attacks any mob that is not undead.
//      When the wither starts to search for prey, it will look for any mob that meets its criteria for killing.
//      Your strategy right now should be to use your bow and shoot arrows at him.
//      If you hit him, he might see you and charge at you.
//      He will shoot blue and black colored skulls that look like one of his many heads.
//      If these projectiles hit you, they will deal a good amount of damage.
//      Damage done is dependent on the difficulty.
//      On normal, if one is hit with a wither skull, the wither effect may be inflicted.
//      Wither is basically the same as poison except you can be killed if your health bar is low and turns your health bar black for its duration so it is slightly hard to see how much health you have.
//      These skulls will deal terrain damage if they hit the ground.
//      The rare, blue skull is prone to destroying blocks with a much higher block resistance, including obsidian.
//      Continue to follow the pattern of shoot, flee, and repeat.
//      Keep doing this to decrease his health.
//      Use the health potions when necessary.
//      When the health reaches half, you will notice a somewhat of a force field around it.
//      The force field causes the wither to take less damage and makes it immune to arrows.
//      At this point, your bow is rendered useless.
//      Consume a golden apple and a strength potion and you have no choice but to charge in.
//      That way, the Wither is within melee range.
//      The wither will do no damage to you while you have regen from the apple.
//      You will also do much more damage because of the strength potion.
//      Hopefully, You can kill the wither in one go with the apple and potion.
//      It should be enough.
//      If you are successful in killing the wither, the wither will explode.
//      The wither drops a small amount of experience and a single Nether star.
//      This Netherstar can be used to make a most desired beacon block.

		, "First a Declaration of Faces any Filter and Extender have. The Main Facing is the Facing you can set using the Wrench and which has 4 Dots around the center Pipe."
		, "The Secondary Facing is the one with the outwards pointing Arrows, that is set using the Monkey Wrench. And the other Sides of the Extender/Filter are the Neutral Facings."
		, "Now that this is clear, we can go for the Functionality. Basically ANYTHING that accesses the Extender through a Neutral or Secondary Facing will get redirected to the Block at the Main Facing."
		, "This means that the Main Facing is usually the Output Side, if you want to insert Stuff through the Neutral Facings or the Secondary one. So attach the Main Facing to the Block you want to extend or have filtering for."
		, "Now to the Secondary Facing: As you know the 5 Facings redirect their Block access to the Main Facing, but the Main Facing itself can redirect all the Block accesses on its Side to the Block on the secondary Facing too."
		, "This means that if you have Input and Output on the same Side of the Block you attach it to, that you can redirect the Output into one Direction using the Secondary Facing, while the Neutral Facings fill the Block on the Main Facing"
		, "The redirect from Main->Secondary is NOT filtered, only the Neutral&Secondary->Main interactions are filtered! I hope this explanation is good enough for you, to actually use the Filters properly."
		, "Extenders and Filters cannot be used adjacent to each other in the sense of 'chained together', this means you have to have something, like a Pipe, between an Extender/Filter and another Extender/Filter, unless they are parallel ofcourse."
